# Bilkent Connect App

Bilkent Connect is a multifunctional social media Android application that aims to satisfy the social needs of a Bilkent student. The typical social media applications usually do not focus on a specific community. Therefore, they cannot be entirely suitable for these specific communities. Bilkent Connect provides a social media platform exclusive to Bilkent University students. Hence, it has diverse features that are designed specifically for
Bilkent students. The main feature of Bilkent Connect is sharing posts with other students, whether anonymously or not, in order to create an accessible environment where students can share their ideas. The second feature is a second-hand sale page where students can buy and sell second-hand school-related items. The third feature is the BBC Cafeteria page, where students can check that day's cafeteria meal and rate or comment on that meal to interact with other students. With all of these features, Bilkent Connect offers a unique experience that is specifically designed for Bilkent students by Bilkent students.
